*Creative's Book Club* is a little project created to help people stay in the habit of reading, creating things and talking to other creatives. The idea is that everyone collectively reads a book (or two), then spends a few hours throughout the month making something. You don't have to work alone, this is a great excuse to collaborate with other creative people, the whole point of this is to build a small community of like minded people, after all. 

The idea is sort of based off of [*Penguin's Student Design Awards*](https://www.penguin.co.uk/company/work-with-us/student-design-award/student-design-award.html), except just for fun, you don't have to be a student and there's no awards (so nothing like it at all really). 

Please get involved if you think it'll be fun!
