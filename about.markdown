# Read books, make stuff! 

Every month we'll give you a book or two to read during/after which you can make something (anything), be it a book cover, a poster, an illustration, a storyboard, a poem, a short story, a game, a web toy, a piece of music - whatever you're inspired to make. The next month we'll compile the favorite pieces of work and share it on our platform! 

In other words, it's just a good excuse to make something that you might not have otherwise.
