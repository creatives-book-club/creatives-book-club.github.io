Hello, welcome to Creative's Book Club! 

I'm hoping that this project will be a hub where creatives of all kinds can come together and make stuff all around a single *"thing"* every month, no matter how big/small. 

Originally, the plan was to focus on book covers/jackets, it's a fun way to practice composition, typography and image-making all in one quick and simple package, so I would encourage that as a way to get into making something if you want to make something but don't know what. As a result, I'll have resources about book cover design & typography around this website somewhere. **However, if you have an idea, please make it, regardless of format/medium.**

The majority of activity for this project will likely be on Instagram ([@creativesbookclub](https://instagr.am/creativesbookclub)) and Twitter ([@creativesbkclub](https://twitter.com/creativesbkclub)), so please make sure to tag us in any stories/fleets/posts with stuff you've made, and use the #creativesbookclub ([ig](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/creativesbookclub/) or [tw](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CreativesBookClub))!

At the end of every month we'll post about the things you've been making, and then on the first of every month we'll post the next set of books! 

You can suggest books by messaging us on any platform/emailing letting us know what books you want to design/make for. 

If you want to contribute to the project in any other way, just have a chat with us!

# **July 2021's Books**

This months books are [Good Omens](#good-omens-by-terry-pratchett--neil-gaiman-1990) and [Nineteen Eighty-Four](#nineteen-eighty-four-by-george-orwell-1949)!

## **Good Omens by Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman (1990)**

[*Content warnings: Racism, Xenophobia, Death, Homophobia, Body horror, Eating disorder*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7c0ed7bb-5527-44eb-a5b7-1d32151ed977/content_warnings)

Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman's classic Apocalypse novel is a great read and is full of themes to draw on for this months work. It's got great fleshed out characters, a fun twist on religious themes, jabs at capitalism & 90s British culture, and is just generally a really entertaining read. There's tons of unique imagery to draw from (for those working on visual pieces), so it's a solid pick for the first option of the first month. 

You probably already know that this book has been adapted to a show recently (and has just been renewed for a second season), so now is the time to get in on the hype and make something *nice*.

**Blurb**
> People have been predicting the end of the world almost from its very beginning, so it’s only natural to be sceptical when a new date is set for Judgement Day. But what if, for once, the predictions are right, and the apocalypse really is due to arrive next Saturday, just after tea?
>
> You could spend the time left drowning your sorrows, giving away all your possessions in preparation for the rapture, or laughing it off as (hopefully) just another hoax. Or you could just try to do something about it.
>
> It’s a predicament that Aziraphale, a somewhat fussy angel, and Crowley, a fast-living demon now finds themselves in. They’ve been living amongst Earth’s mortals since The Beginning and, truth be told, have grown rather fond of the lifestyle and, in all honesty, are not actually looking forward to the coming Apocalypse.
>
> And then there’s the small matter that someone appears to have misplaced the Antichrist…

## **Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell (1949)**

[*Content warnings: Torture, Violence, Confinement, Sexual content, Death, Misogyny, Rape, Alcoholism*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/96f73855-48ee-44d3-9297-cd625fae83b4/content_warnings)

**Blurb**
> *Hidden away in the Record Department of the sprawling Ministry of Truth, Winston Smith skilfully rewrites the past to suit the needs of the Party. Yet he inwardly rebels against the totalitarian world he lives in, which demands absolute obedience and controls him through the all-seeing telescreens and the watchful eye of Big Brother, symbolic head of the Party. In his longing for truth and liberty, Smith begins a secret love affair with a fellow-worker Julia, but soon discovers the true price of freedom is betrayal.*

Unarguably the most politically influential dystopian ever written, 1984 is possibly more relevant today than the year of it's original publication, making the novel required reading in today's culture. Pretty much all political sides find something to take away from Orwell's picture of a totalitarian socialist society, and terms coined in the novel such as Big Brother, groupthink, thoughtcrime, etc., are referenced ad nauseam in articles, media, social media, parliament and pretty much everywhere else (as well as the term "Orwellian", which is used to describe totalitarian ideas/policies).

In 2021, Nineteen Eighty-Four came into the public domain in most territories other than the United States, so you can read it for free at [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Orwell1984preywo) and Amazon includes it for [free with Prime Reading](https://www.amazon.co.uk/1984-AmazonClassics-George-Orwell-ebook/dp/B088H7KLCG) for those with Kindles.
