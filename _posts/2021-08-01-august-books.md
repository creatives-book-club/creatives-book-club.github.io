# **A note on the work so far**

Hello, welcome back to the club!

Obviously since we're just starting out and testing the water for this idea, we expected that not many people would join in, but we didn't expect that we would just be completely unable to create anything in the time we gave ourselves (ðŸ˜ž). Thank you to those reading and following, and we're really sorry that we couldn't help lead the way. We'll collect and post everything this week though!

# **August 2021's Books**

This months books are [The Hobbit](#the-hobbit-by-j-r-r-tolkein-1937) and [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](#the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-by-marie-kondo-2011)!

## **The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkein (1937)**

[*Content warnings: Death, Violence, Kidnapping, Fatphobia, Drug use, Xenophobia, Animal death, Confinement, Blood*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/935eea29-cdc0-4487-b1f6-db74cfd62c22/content_warnings)

We thought we'd stick to another classic fantasy story, and there are none more fantastic and revered than The Hobbit. J. R. R. Tolkein's prelude to The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a (sort-of) family friendly introduction to Tolkein's incredibly detailed Middle Earth setting, introducing many characters and themes that show up in the larger books. It's a much shorter read than the previous books, and is much more light hearted, so make sure to enjoy it!

**Blurb**
>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

>Written for J.R.R. Tolkienâ€™s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.

## **The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo (2011)**

[*Content warnings: Ableism, Fatphobia*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b89c482b-a551-45f6-9ac5-ea1514d5ea3b/content_warnings)

A non-fiction option for this month, Marie Kondo's The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up is a classic self-help and home improvement book. A pre-cursor to her hit Netflix series, this book captures the same feeling of wholesome and helpful tidying tips that Kondo has become known for. There's a lot in this book to draw on, including anecdotes from Kondo's clients that may prove inspiring, or that the very least amusing! I personally (Ash) just underwent my own Marie Kondo style tidying marathon and loved it, so I hope you all come to love this book as much as I do!

**Blurb**
> Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).

>With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house "spark joy" (and which don't), this international best seller featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home - and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.
